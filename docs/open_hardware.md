# :simple-opensourcehardware: Open hardware designs
please get in touch if you're interested in buying any of these designs. I may have some boards in stock or can schedule a manufacturing run with reasonably short lead times.

# ui_board_1u
A versatile User Interface for 1U Systems

  * 256 x 64 OLED display with high readability
  * Rotary encoder and 2 multi-color status LEDs
  * Proven design. Originated at LBNL and adopted across multiple projects and labs
  * Optimized for 1U chassis. Solves the common problem of fitting a readable display within strict 1U height constraints

### Why it exists
Rack-mount “pizza box” systems often need a simple, reliable way to show status, report errors, and allow basic configuration -- but integrating a front-panel UI in a 1U chassis is surprisingly time-consuming.

ui_board_1u exists to remove that friction: it is a ready-to-use, open hardware UI module with a proven mechanical footprint, designed specifically for tight 1U height constraints, so engineers can add a professional front-panel interface without reinventing the mechanics, display choice, or software from scratch.
