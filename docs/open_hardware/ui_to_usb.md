A USB Interface Add-On for [ui_board_1u](ui_board_1u.md)

ui_to_usb enables simple and reliable USB interfacing. It is designed for use with embedded Linux systems such as Linux-based PCs and Zynq FPGA platforms, making it easy to integrate a full user interface into these environments.

The board is fully bus-powered and uses an FT232 USB-to-serial interface, ensuring driver support out of the box on most Linux distributions. This allows rapid setup without custom kernel drivers.

A dedicated user-space library will be provided, demonstrating:

  * Display initialization and drawing
  * Reading the rotary encoder
  * Controlling the onboard LEDs

Beyond embedded systems, ui_to_usb also simplifies PC-based development, making it ideal for prototyping and testing UI code directly on a desktop or laptop.
