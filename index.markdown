Dr. Michael Betz is an Electrical Engineer by training and provides consulting 
services for the __design__ and __development__ of hard- and software.

In previous projects he worked with

  * Large scale, decentralized control systems for accelerators _(like EPICS or FESA)_
  * Industrial Programmable Logic controllers _(PLCs)_ and field-bus interfaces
  * Accelerator __interlock systems__ for personal and machine protection
  * Microwave __receiver front-ends__ with very low noise and very high dynamic range
  * __RF feedback systems__ to control phase and amplitude with
    high precision and sub-ms latency
  * Custom-designed instruments for pulsed RF measurements (amplitude and phase)
  * __Embedded Linux__ on Xilinx devices _(Debian, Yocto, Buildroot, Docker)_
  * ADC and DAC interfacing to FPGAs _(LVDS, JESD204)_
  * Low latency __signal processing in FPGAs__
  * __Soft-CPU integration__ in FPGAs _(PicoRV32, VexRiscv)_
  * __Embedded software development__ _(Atmega, ESP32, ARM Cortex-M4, RiscV)_
  * Design of secure and cost-optimized IOT systems _(ESP32, MQTT, TLS)_
  * High-throughput event processing systems for gamma-ray detectors
  * __Certified radiation protection expert__ in Switzerland

His strengths lie in the realization of one-offs and prototypes, where
creativity and resourceful thinking are required to solve unique technical
problems.

He previously worked for
  * CERN, Beam Instrumentation and RF group, Switzerland
  * Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Advanced Light Source RF group, California
  * Terapet SA, Nuclear Imaging devices for Proton Therapy, Switzerland
  * Turkish Accelerator Center, Ankara
