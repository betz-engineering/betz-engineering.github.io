# Dr. Michael Betz
_Embedded Systems & RF Engineering Consultant_

I help companies bring complex electronic and embedded systems to life ‚Äî from first concept to working prototype and beyond.

Whether you're building a new product, improving an existing one, or need expert help on a niche technical challenge, I can support you at every step.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Product & Hardware Design
- Full-stack embedded systems: hardware (PCBs), firmware, drivers, and interfaces
- Cost-optimized embedded devices for low-power or battery-operated applications
- Sensor networks and secure communication solutions
- High-performance FPGA-based data acquisition systems
- Feature upgrades and design improvements based on user feedback
- Troubleshooting and design-for-manufacturing support

**Special focus**: Fast turnaround for one-offs, prototypes, and functional mock-ups
‚Äî turning ideas into tangible solutions.

I've also worked extensively with medical device development, and am experienced in designing to **IEC 60601** standards.

## ‚ö° Specialized Experience: Particle Accelerators & RF Systems

I‚Äôve contributed to advanced RF systems for some of the world‚Äôs most respected research institutions and labs.

### Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
