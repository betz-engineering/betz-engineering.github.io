# Dr. Michael Betz
_Embedded Systems & RF Engineering Consultant_

I help companies bring complex electronic and embedded systems to life ‚Äî from first concept to working prototype and beyond.

Whether you're building a new product, improving an existing one, or need expert help on a niche technical challenge, I can support you at every step.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Product & Hardware Design
- Full-stack embedded systems: hardware (PCBs), firmware, drivers, and interfaces
- Cost-optimized embedded devices for low-power or battery-operated applications
- Sensor networks and secure communication solutions
- High-performance FPGA-based data acquisition systems
- Feature upgrades and design improvements based on user feedback
- Troubleshooting and design-for-manufacturing support

**Special focus**: Fast turnaround for one-offs, prototypes, and functional mock-ups
‚Äî turning ideas into tangible solutions.

I've also worked extensively with medical device development, and am experienced in designing to **IEC 60601** standards.

## ‚ö° Specialized Experience: Particle Accelerators & RF Systems

I‚Äôve contributed to advanced RF systems for some of the world‚Äôs most respected research institutions and labs.

### Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
[![CERN logo](/pics/cern.png){: style="width: 110px; float: right;"}](https://www.cern.ch)
- Ultra-low-noise microwave front-ends for beam instrumentation
- Coherent phase-locked down-converters
- **Invented and rolled out a user-friendly Python API** that became widely used across CERN for accessing the accelerator control system

### Advanced Light Source (ALS)

- High-power RF systems (Klystrons, IOTs, Tetrodes): commissioning, maintenance & troubleshooting
- Control and safety systems (EPICS, PLCs)
- Developer of an [RF Vector Voltmeter](https://github.com/michael-betz/zed_vvm) used across the facility
- Contributor to [Marble](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/Marble) and [Bedrock](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/Bedrock)

### Tarla ‚Äì Free Electron Laser

- Commissioning of a superconducting TESLA cavity
- RF measurements, machine protection and control system design

### Industry
- EMC and EMI pre-compliance testing (CISPR 11, EN 55011)
- Signal processing tools for quality assurance workflows

# Let's Work Together

I'm open to projects of all sizes ‚Äî from solving a single technical issue to supporting full product development.
