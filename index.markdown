Dr. Michael Betz works as a freelance Electrical Engineer, __designing__, __producing__ and __troubleshooting__ electronics and embedded systems.

# Product design

  * Complete hardware design for a product (PCB, firmware, drivers, user-interface)
  * Design of cost-optimized embedded devices (battery operation, secure communication, sensor networks)
  * Design of high performance FPGA-based data acquisition systems
  * Technical support for existing products and Design For Manufacturing (reviewing, debugging, optimizing, following up issues)
  * Adding new features to a product based on user feedback

His specialty is the realization of one-offs, functional mock-ups and prototypes, taking the idea for a product and bringing it into reality.

Due to his previous projects, Michael has extensive experience in designing medical electrical devices according to the __IEC 60601__ standards.

In any case, he is happy to look into any of your technical problems, big or small.

  * Large scale, decentralized control systems for accelerators _(like EPICS or FESA)_
  * Industrial Programmable Logic controllers _(PLCs)_ and field-bus interfaces
  * Accelerator __interlock systems__ for personal and machine protection
  * Microwave __receiver front-ends__ with very low noise and very high dynamic range
  * __RF feedback systems__ to control phase and amplitude with
    high precision and sub-ms latency
  * Custom-designed instruments for pulsed RF measurements (amplitude and phase)
